Certainly! Hereâ€™s a concise explanation of the sorting algorithms project that you've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

Project Overview: Sorting Algorithms Visualization
This project is an interactive web application designed to demonstrate three fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. Each algorithm is implemented in JavaScript, allowing users to visualize how these algorithms sort an array of numbers step by step.

Key Features
User Input:
Users can input a comma-separated list of numbers into a text field, which the application will use as the dataset to sort.
Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort:
A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.
Insertion Sort:
This algorithm builds the sorted array one element at a time by taking each element from the unsorted section and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted section.
Selection Sort:
This algorithm divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted section. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted section and moves it to the end of the sorted section.
Visual Feedback:

After executing a sorting algorithm, the application displays:
The sorted array.
The total number of passes (iterations) taken to sort the array.
The state of the array after each pass, providing a clear visual representation of how the sorting process unfolds.
Styling:

The application features a user-friendly interface with a clean layout. CSS is used to enhance the aesthetics, including background colors, button styles, and clear formatting for displaying sorting passes.
Educational Purpose
This project serves as a practical educational tool for understanding basic sorting algorithms. By visualizing each step, users can gain insights into how different sorting techniques work and appreciate their relative efficiency. The project can be used in educational settings or as a self-learning tool for students and enthusiasts interested in algorithms and programming.
